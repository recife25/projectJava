str to lowercase 
how to compare  / arrays 
palidrome - if str reverse of that str is the same as original str 
“Niagara o roar again”
“niagara o roar agaiN”

Prove that the string “Niagara o roar again” is a palindrome
consider str - "Niagara o roar again"
//consider str - change to lowercase
consider str - consider the length of str
consider str - method to reverse str 
travers str - use the for loop (strLength -1)
if str lowercase == reverse str lowercase
system out println - is palindrome
else 
system out println - is not palidrome 

char vs string 
java string class doc - review method has for class - string into array 
array of chars 
index chars vs string 
char compare ignore case - lowercase uppercase -


[optional] Prove that the string “Niagara o roar again” is a palindrome
